some plotting of the graphs

# METRICS
betweenness centrality
closeness centrality
local clustering coeff
avg clustering coeff
number of graphlets
presence of patterns (?

must establish a threshold in [-10, +10] to consider a node a 'bad actor'
computation of the metrics for bad actors

# RANDOM GRAPHS
creation of set of random graphs (10-15 is enough?) - Chung-Li model
computation of metris for random graphs
Monte-Carlo approach -> z-score, p-value of metrics
comparison of the metrics

comparison of subgraph-structures and/or graphlets with random graphs (?
